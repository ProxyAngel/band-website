              Formed in Iowa in 1995, Slipknot featured Anders Colsefni on vocals, Donnie Steel and Josh Brainard on guitar, Joey Jordison on drums, Clown on percussion and Paul Gray on bass. Mick and Craig joined a year later. Then Corey joined in 1997 leading Sid and Chris to join in 1998 leaving Jim Root to complete the classic lineup in 1999. Masks and boiler suits has been their band attire since 1997, with the original idea coming from Shawn Crahan who developed the character "Shawn The Clown". The bands logo is a nine-pointed star also known as a nonagram that represents the strong bond between all nine members(nothing to do with Satan or religion, despite some claims from scared parents). In 2012, Slipknot launched Knotfest and held it as a touring festival and a destination festival in several countries including the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Mexico, Colombia and France. Paul Gray was replaced by V Man in 2014 following his death in 2010, and Jay Weinberg replaced Joey Jordison following his departure from Slipknot in 2013 following a battle with his health. Later in 2019, Michael Pfaff joined the group in the place of longtime percussionist, Chris Fehn, who departed after wearing the No. 3 badge since 1998.
